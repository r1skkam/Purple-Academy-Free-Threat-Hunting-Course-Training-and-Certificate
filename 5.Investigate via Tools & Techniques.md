# 5. Investigate via Tools & Techniques
## 5.1 Introduction
Now, we have a hypothesis, and we know how to test this hypothesis; In other words, we have the search query. So, we can now move on to the next step, which is "investigate via a tools and techniques".

In this step, the hypothesis is investigated using a variety of tools and techniques. The goal of the step is to prove or disprove the hypothesis. So, we hunt the threat in this step.

Prior to hunting, we need to do three important checks: 
- Which data sources we need? 
- Do we have the required data visibility?
- Do we have the required historical data for hunting?

## 5.2 Finding Required Data Sources
Let's start with the first check, "which data sources we need?" 

MITRE ATT&CK provides the names of the high-level data sources required to detect or hunt the ATT&CK technique or sub-technique.  For example, MITRE ATT&CK gives Command Execution, File Modification, Process Creation, Windows Registry Key Creation, and Windows Registry Key Modification as data sources to detect the Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder sub-technique. 

Still, we need to do additional research on the data sources for the specific procedure or adversary action that we are hunting for.

Fortunately, a BAS Detection Library, also provided  detailed information about required data sources to hunt a specific adversary action or procedure. As seen in the screenshot, we can use "Audit Process Creation" logs, and we should also enable "Include Command Line" option for these logs. So, we know the right log source with the right level of detail now. 

The second check is "do we have the required data visibility?", and the third check is "do we have the required historical data for hunting?". 

These checks are related to the collection of required logs. If we don't have the relevant logs, we cannot hunt a threat. The Detection Analytics feature of a BAS tool, helps you to validate that the required logs are collected to hunt the adversary action.

## 5.3 Starting the Hunt
Now, we know the required search query for hunting,and we have the required data visibility, in other words, relevant logs. So, we can start the threat hunt.

Let's remember the components of our search query. We are searching for the "reg.exe" process, registry add operation, "WindowsDefenderUpdate"   as the name of the new entry. 

We can hunt this adversary action in SIEMs and also EDRs, since this action occurs on endpoints. As an example, I run this query on Carbon Black EDR. As shown in the screenshot, the EDR found logs about the search query. Let's look at the first log.

We are looking at the detail of the first log. According to the log, a new entry was added to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run  run registry key. The name of the new entry is "WindowsDefenderUpdater". So, we proved our hypothesis. We find a malicious action used by MuddyWater, for persistence. 

If we cannot find any result, in other words, if we cannot prove our hypothesis, we should think about its reasons. Maybe this threat exists in our environment, but we wouldn't find it due to a tool or data constraints. Maybe our search query was wrong. Or, this threat really does not exist in our environment.

Until now, we created a hypothesis, investigated with a search query, and find the malicious action used by MuddyWater for persistence. So, we proved our hypothesis. Now, we should pass this information to the Incident Response team.
