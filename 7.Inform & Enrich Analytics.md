# 7.Inform & Enrich Analytics
## 7.1 Introduction
Let's move on to the last step of the threat hunting loop, which is "inform & enrich analytics". In this step, we operationalize the current hunting process before starting a new hunt. 

We shouldn't hunt for the same threat over and over. If possible, we should convert search queries of the current hunt into new automated detection rules. Threat hunters can work with detection engineers to detect the hunter threat in the future. In this way, the threat you hunt can now be detected automatically by detection tools, and you won't have to manually hunt for the same threat in the future. So, you can find more time to test new hypotheses.

Even if you cannot convert search queries into automated detection rules, you should save the search query and schedule it to quickly repeat hunting in the future.

## 7.2 Enrich & Validate Analytics with BAS
Pics Detection Library includes vendor-specific detection rules for SIEM and EDR vendors and vendor-neutral Sigma rules. You can utilize these rules to enrich your analytics.

Moreover, you can validate deployed detection rules with the Detection Analytics feature of the Picus Continuous Security Validation Platform. As you can see in the screenshot, we created a detection rule with a search query used in the thread hunt, and Picus validated that the rule works and creates alerts.
