## 2.1 What Is Threat Hunting?
Threat Hunting is the hypothesis-driven proactive detection of malicious activity.

In detail, threat hunting is: 
- proactively identifying threats in our networks and systems,
- finding threats that already compromised our environment, and
- detecting advanced threats which evade our existing solutions.

## 2.2 Where Does Threat Hunting Fits?
Now, I want to describe where does threat hunting fits? 
During a threat hunt, first, you create a hypothesis, then you investigate it. 
You can uncover new TTPs and IOCs during a threat hunt. You must pass this information to the Detection Engineering team, so they can create new detection rules from these TTPs. If detection engineers discover new alerts and incidents, they will pass this information to the Incident Response team for triage, investigation, and response.
The Threat Hunting team may also discover new incidents during the hunting. They also pass this information to the Incident Response team. 
Sometimes, threat hunters find malware in endpoints. They will pass these samples to the Malware Analysis team to uncover new TTPs and IOCs.

## 2.3 What Are the Goals of Threat Hunting?
Now, we come to the goals of threat hunting point.

Business goals are: 
- reducing the dwell time, and
- minimizing residual risks by stopping adversaries before completing their objectives.

The technical goals of threat hunting are: 
- detecting advanced attacks which are evading security controls
- detecting TTPs instead of IOCs, and
- detecting malicious behavior quicker and more frequently

## 2.4 Threat Hunting Problems
I'd now like to change direction and talk about problems in threat hunting.
- The first problem is the skill shortage in the cybersecurity industry. According to the SANS 2020 Threat Hunting Survey, only 19% of threat hunters are working as full-time threat hunters at their organizations. 81% are using staff that also fulfill other roles within the organization, including incident response, forensics, managing SOC alerts, and system administration.
- The second problem is the lack of formal threat hunting processes. Only 37% of organizations have a formal program and methodology with assigned staff for threat hunting.
- The last problem is about measuring the effectiveness of threat hunting. Only 53% of organizations are using ad hoc methods to measure the effectiveness of threat hunting. Most of the organizations are not using an industry-based  framework like MITRE ATT&CK or custom frameworks.  

These problems show that organizations don't have adequate human resources for threat hunting, and they perform ad-hoc threat hunting operations.
