# 4. Create Hypothesis
## 4.1 Introduction
Let's deep dive into each step of the threat hunting Loop.

The first step is the "create hypothesis" step. Hypotheses are analytic questions that define the focus of the threat hunt, such as detecting a specific threat actor, tool, or technique. So, in this step, threat hunters ask questions, such as "how would a threat actor infiltrate our network?"These questions must be broken down into specific and measurable hypotheses that describe the threats that may exist in the network and how they can be detected.

A hypothesis must be testable, which means that threat hunters must have required data visibility, and they must know the TTPs to test hypotheses and detailed steps prescribing how to implement an adversary technique.

## 4.2 Hypothesis Creation Types
There are different types of hypothesis creation. We will talk about the most commonly used ones. 
- The first one is the intelligence-driven hypothesis. Threat intelligence can help threat hunters construct hypotheses by providing a foundation for the questions they ask. 
- The second approach is the situational awareness based hypothesis. Threat hunters understand the IT environment in their organization. Then, they identify when the environment changes in a significant way. Having this situational awareness, threat hunters can create hypotheses.
- The next approach is domain expertise. Each Hunter has a unique set of experiences and skills that influence hypothesis generation. However, experience often comes with an unwanted side effect: bias. 

We will now examine these approaches in more detail and generate sample hypotheses using these approaches.

## 4.3 Intelligence-Driven hypotheses
The first approach to create a hypothesis is intelligence-driven. In this approach, threat hunters create hypotheses based on threat intelligence, such as Indicator of Compromises (IOCs) or Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). 

We provide two best practices for this approach: 
- The first one is avoiding over-reliance on IOCs. You could become overburdened with low-quality matches if you try to create a hypothesis that requires analysis of every data in a feed or every IOC in an intelligence report. Instead, use IOCs for quick wins but move up the Pyramid of Pain to understand adversary TTPs. 
- The second best practice is that hypotheses should be based on TTPswith additional context provided by assessments of the threat and geopolitical landscapes.

An example hypothesis based on threat intelligence about a threat actor is that "I know that the Hafnium Group is a high priority threat for my organization because of our location and industry. If this threat actor is present in our network, we should be able to detect evidence of multiple techniques used by the Hafnium Group, consistent with their known attack paths".

## 4.4 Situational Awareness Driven Hypothesis
The second hypothesis creation approach is the situational awareness driven hypothesis. According to this approach, defenders must be aware of their surroundings and be able to identify when it changes significantly. Analysts can develop hypotheses about adversary activities that might occur in their environment if they have situational awareness. 

- The first best practice around the situational awareness hypothesis is that focusing on the most critical assets and information, in other words, crown jewels. In order to identify important assets, you can use the Crown Jewels Analysis technique that we mentioned earlier. 
- Situational analysis requires keeping up with rapidly changing infrastructure, applications, and vulnerabilities. As the second best practice, use automation, particularly in dashboarding, reporting, and risk scoring, to keep up with this rapidly changing environment.

Let's create a situational awareness driven hypothesis. I will limit my search to just high-value targets identified with Crown Jewels Analysis, and domain admin accounts are included in these high-value targets. My hypothesis is "if attackers abuse domain admin credentials in our network, we should be able to detect outliers like a spike in domain admin account logons."

## 4.5 Domain Expertise Driven Hypothesis
Now, we come to the third and last approach, which is domain expertise driven hypothesis creation. This approach is related to the hunter's domain expertise. Of course, each hunter has a unique set of experiences and skills that influence their hypothesis generation.

As we mentioned in the situational awareness approach, a good hunter should have knowledge of both the organization's network and the threats faced. So, domain expertise can be viewed as both cyber threat intelligence and situational awareness in a historical context.

It is obvious that experience is very useful for hunting. However, experience often comes with an unwanted side effect, bias. Hunters need to be aware of cognitive biases to ensure good decisions are made and accurate conclusions are drawn. As a best practice, models like the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis can be used to overcome bias by structuring threat data.

## 4.6 Example: Creating a Hypothesis Around a Threat Group
Now, we will create a hypothesis. As a kick-start method, I choose to create a hypothesis around a most likely threat actor. Suppose we have a threat intelligence indicating the MuddyWater threat group is targeting companies in our industry and country.
So, my hypothesis is, "according to a new threat intelligence, the MuddyWater APT group is targeting telecommunication companies in Europe. So, MuddyWater is a high-priority threat for my organization. If the MuddyWater group is present in our network, we should be able to detect evidence of multiple techniques used by the MuddyWater group, consistent with their known attack paths." 

Not that we should know TTPs used by the MuddyWater group to test our hypothesis. So, how can we learn these TTPs used by the MuddyWater  group? MITRE ATT&CK provides techniques and tools used by hundreds of threat groups.  ATT&CK also provides descriptions of techniques, as you can see in screenshots. 

However, knowing the definition of a technique is not enough to form a hypothesis. An attack technique can be implemented by using multiple procedures. A procedure is a step by step instruction on how the attacker implements a technique in detail. The threat hunter must know the specific procedure to test the hypothesis. Still, we need to know specific procedures used by the MuddyWater group.

Threat Libraries of Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tools provide specific procedures used by a threat group to implement the attack technique. For example, the first screenshot shows actions of an adversary emulation playbook, also known as attack scenario, of the MuddyWater threat group. The MITRE ATT&CK technique of the marked attack scenario action is "Modify Registry". "Registry Ru, Keys / Startup Folder" is also an appropriate MITRE ATT&CK sub-technique for this action. Its procedure is that "creating a new registry key named WindowsDefenderUpdate  in HKLM hive. 

The second screenshot shows the detail of the action. According to its description, the MuddyWater group uses the reg.exe  command-line utility to create a new registry key in the HKLM hive for persistence. So, this BAS Threat Library provides detailed descriptions of adversary behaviors.

A comprehensive BAS library like Picus provides adversary emulation playbooks of threat groups, their malware, and their attack campaigns. These playbooks  help you to find TTPs of threat groups.

## 4.7 Creating a Hypothesis Around a Specific Procedure (Action)
Now, we know the specific actions of MuddyWater. But, we cannot hunt all actions at once in a big hypothesis. So, we need to create sub-hypothesis utilizing an adversary action. In our example, the MuddyWater threat group creates a new registry, run key named "WindowsDefenderUpdater" to maintain persistence. Accordingly, our sub-hypothesis is that "the MuddyWater Group added a new Registry Run Key named WindowsDefenderUpdater through reg.exe command-line utility in our Window systems to preserve persistence." 

(In this sub-) hypothesis, we use 3 MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
- The first one is "Modify Registry", since we are adding a new entry to the registry. 
- The second technique is "Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder", because we add a new entry to the registry run key to maintain persistence.
- The third technique is Masquerading, because the name of the entry WindowsDefenderUpdater that seems like a legitimate name, but it is not. There is not a legitimate service named "WindowsDefenderUpdater" in Windows. 

Until now, we learned that the process name that can be used in the search query is "reg.exe",  the registry operation is "add", and the name of the new registry entry is "WindowsDefenderUpdater".  Our example is a well-defined procedure, so we can easily create the search query. However, most of the time, it was not simple as in this example. Especially, ambiguous queries may result in false positives.

Some BAS platforms provide vendor-specific or vendor-agnostic search queries for adversary actions. For example, you can see that the specific search query named"persistence viaWindowsDefenderUpdaterautorun key" for IBM Radar SIEMin the screenshot. You can use the search query to hunt for this adversary action.
