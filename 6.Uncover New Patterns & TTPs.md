# 6. Uncover New Patterns & TTPs
## 6.1 Introduction
After hypothesis generation and investigation, we found the TTP we were searching for in our environment, but it does not end our threat hunt. We have completed two steps and we must complete two more steps.

The third step is "uncover new patterns & TTPs". If you encounter a malicious pattern or a new TTP, first, you should put a boundary on the hunt. You should not hunt for this TTP. You should document the TTP and open questions and plan a future huntfor this new TTP. 

Moreover, a threat hunt may reveal non-malicious but suspicious or risky configurations or behaviors, such as
- unpatched or misconfigured systems
- logging blind spots.

This information can be passed onto relevant teams, such as SIEM managers, to fill the logging gaps.

## 6.2 Uncovering New TTPs
Let's remember the log the EDR found. We caught a command in the log. We can investigate this command to uncover new TTPs. 

Let's start with the first step. This command adds a new entry to a registry run key. It includes another command given by the "d" parameter, which starts with cmstp.exe. So, this command will run at each system restart. 

Upon system restart, cmstp.exe will execute DefenderService.inf  file. When we look at the content of the DefenderService.inf file, we found the string starting with scrobj.dll,  which you can see in the slide.

So, cmstp.exe will execute Defender.sct file, which includes an obfuscated JavaScript. The main function of the JavaScript code decodes the Base64 content of another file, WindowsDefender.ini. 

WindowsDefender.ini file includes an encoded PowerShell script. The JavaScript in the Defender.sct file executes the decoded PowerShell script using the command line on the screen.

So there are other TTPs in the malicious command that we caught in logs during the hunt. As I mentioned before, we should put a boundary on the hunt, which means we shouldn't hunt for these TTPs at the moment. We should document these TTPs and plan future hunts for them.

For example, running a .inf file with CMSTP is a suspicious activity. We can plan a future hunt for it. Another suspicious activity is decoding and running a PowerShell script in a file by using a JavaScript code in another file. We can also plan a future hunt for this action.

## 6.3 Uncovering Logging Gaps
During a threat hunt, we can also uncover logging gaps. For example, we can reveal that some important logs are not collected in SIEMs or EDRs. We can pass these logging gaps to SIEM or EDR managers. It is important to learn logging gaps to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of threat hunting processes. 

Detection analytics feature of Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tools like Picus uncovers logging gaps to test the hypothesis and preparing for future hunts.

Picus also visualize technique-based logging gaps on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
