## 3.1 Threat Hunting Loop
This leads directly to my next point. It's critical for your team to develop a structured cyber hunting approach to avoid one-off, potentially useless "hunting trips". It is very challenging to do threat hunting without sticking to a methodology.

Although, some organizations have very detailed methodologies, generally speaking, there are four main steps in threat hunting. Sqrrl has created the Threat Hunting Loop shown in this slide that consists of four stages that describe a successful hunting strategy.

A hunt team's goal should be to complete the loop as swiftly and effectively as possible. The faster you can iterate, the more you'll be able to automate new processes and move on to new threats.

Here we are sharing the Sqrrl's Threat Hunting Loop.
- The first step in a hunt is to create evidence-based hypothesis. Hypothesis can be used by a threat hunter to build an attack scenario using detection and analytics techniques. 
- The hypothesis is then investigated using a variety of tools and techniques in the second step. The goal of this step, is to prove or disprove the hypothesis. 
- The threat hunting loop's third step is to figure out what malicious patterns and TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) adversaries utilized to carry out their attacks. This step will lead to the discovery of new TTPs within your environment.
- Successful threat hunting queries lay the groundwork for informing and enriching automated analytics. Once you've found a query to detect threats that works, automate it so that your team can focus on the new hunt.

## 3.2 How Do We Kick-Start at Threat Hunting?
Let's discuss how do we kick-start threat hunting? We have three recommendations: 
- First of all, you can focus on the threat actors targeting your industry or country or where the country your business is active.
- Another way for kick-starting is focusing on the techniques that are most used by adversaries. As an example, Picus Labs analyzed tens of thousands of real-world threat samples collected from numerous sources; Picus Labs revealed the most prevalent MITRE ATT&CK techniques and tactics to help you focus on what significantly improves your security.
- Our third recommendation is to start with the most important assets and information in your environment. You may use the Crown Jewels Analysis (CJA) method to identify cyber assets that are the most critical to accomplishing your organization's mission. Briefly, you should start the Crown Jewels Analysis process by identifying the organization's core missions and resume by mapping these missions to the assets and information. Then, you should document these assets and finalize the process by constructing attack graphs that determine dependencies and analyzing attack paths, and rating vulnerabilities for severity.
