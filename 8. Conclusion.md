# 8. Conclusion
## 8.1 Threat Hunting Maturity
This is the Threat Hunting Maturity Model, which is also developed by Sqrrl. Your aim should be to increase your level of hunting maturity. 

At the level 0, initial,  there is little or no data collection, and our detection relies on automated alerting.  So, we cannot perform threat hunting at this level. 

At level 1, minimal, we can search for low-level threat indicators, such as file hashes, IP addresses, and domain names. 

At the level 2, procedural, organizations can learn and use procedures created by others on a semi-regular basis, and they can make slight changes, but they are not yet capable of developing entirely new procedures. Organizations at this and higher levels have a high level of routine data collection capabilities,

At the level 3, innovative, at least a few hunters exist in this organization who are familiar with a variety of data analysis tools and can use them to detect malicious activities. These organizations are able to establish their own procedures rather than relying on those provided by others. 

At the level 4, leading, in addition to the level 3 skills, organizations use automation. Any effective hunting procedure will be operationalized and converted into automated detection at this stage. Because of the high level of automation, they may concentrate their efforts on developing a continuous stream of new hunting processes, resulting in continuous improvement of the detection program as a whole. 

As we saw today, a comprehensive BAS tool like Picus can help you reach level 4 with its features such as Threat Library, Detection Library, Detection Analytics. You can fill your data collection gaps and build a high level of routine data collection capability. You can write your own data analysis procedures with the help of TTP details and search queries provided by the BAS threat and detection libraries. You can also turn successful procedures into automated detection rules and validate them using the detection analytics technology of a BAS tool.

However, this does not mean you don't need skilled threat hunters if you're using a BAS tool, Threathunting is one of the most human dependent activities in cybersecurity. We do not eliminate your threat hunter needs; we aim to empower your threat hunters to do their job better and faster, thus enabling more hypotheses to be tested to increase the level of cybersecurity of your organization.

## 8.2 Conclusion
In conclusion, threathunting is no longer an option but a necessity. A formal threat hunting model helps threat hunters to conduct thorough and focused threat hunting. 

A comprehensive BAS tool, such  as Picus, helps threat hunters in different steps of the threat hunting loop.

- It provides TTPs and their detailed usage by threat actors to support hypotheses creation.
- It also provides required log sources in detail to detect a TTP, and validates the required data visibility to test a hypothesis. 
- Moreover, a complete BAS tool helps organizations to increase their threat hunting maturity.

## 8.3 Next Steps
Now, you've seen all the content of the course, so you can take the certification exam. 

You will be allowed three attempts to pass the exam. If you were able to successfully complete the exam with a minimum score of 80%, you will get an email from Purple Academy that includes a link to your digital credentials. These credentials are similar to the badges you see on LinkedIn. They are also verifiable and linked to your name and email address.

You worked hard to earn Purple Academy badges, so why not share your achievement with your network and friends? You can easily share your credentials on popular platforms such as LinkedIn. Research shows that professionals who share digital credentials to networking sites are discovered by employers at a rate of six times higher than those who do not. 

Please tell your friends and colleagues about Purple Academy, so they can also benefit from free courses in Purple Academy.

This brings me to the end of this course. Thank you for attending the course. I hope you enjoyed this course, and I hope to see you in the next course.
